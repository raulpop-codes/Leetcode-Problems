# 1. Two Sum

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return
indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you
may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: The sum of nums[0] and nums[1] is 2 + 7 = 9, which equals the target.
 Therefore, the indices [0, 1] are returned.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of nums[1] and nums[2] is 2 + 4 = 6, which equals the target.
Therefore, the indices [1, 2] are returned.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: The sum of nums[0] and nums[1] is 3 + 3 = 6, which equals the target.
Therefore, the indices [0, 1] are returned.
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Complexity

- Time: O(n)
